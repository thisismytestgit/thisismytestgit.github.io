# High Performance Computing

At IARC, HPC (High Performance Computing), HTC (High Throughput Computing) or simply cluster refer to the same system. It is a set of powerful computers (servers) that interact together to run intensive calculations or tasks, usually called "jobs".

Named Osiris, IARC HPC/HTC/cluster is the computing engine "behind the scene" for the SIT platform.
